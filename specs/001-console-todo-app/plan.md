# Implementation Plan: Console Todo App

**Branch**: `001-console-todo-app` | **Date**: 2026-01-02 | **Spec**: specs/001-console-todo-app/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-console-todo-app/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of an in-memory Python console Todo application that provides core task management functionality (add, view, update, delete, mark complete/incomplete) with a menu-driven CLI interface. The application follows clean architecture principles with separation of concerns and stores all data in memory only.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+ (as specified in constitution)
**Primary Dependencies**: Built-in Python libraries only (no external dependencies)
**Storage**: In-memory only, no persistence (as specified in constitution and spec)
**Testing**: pytest for unit and integration tests
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform console application (Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Project Type**: Single project with clean architecture layers
**Performance Goals**: Sub-second response times for all operations, minimal memory footprint
**Constraints**: No external dependencies, console-based UI only, in-memory storage
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user application, designed for personal task management

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **No Manual Coding**: All implementation will be generated by Claude Code from specs
- **Clean Architecture**: Follow separation of concerns with models, services, and CLI layers
- **Menu-Driven CLI**: All features accessible via console menu as specified
- **In-Memory Only**: Data remains in memory only, no files/databases as specified
- **Auto-Generated Stable IDs**: Tasks will have auto-incremented integer IDs
- **Readable and Testable Code**: Code will be beginner-friendly and well-tested

**Structure Decision**: Single project with clean architecture layers following models/services/cli/lib pattern to ensure separation of concerns as required by constitution principle of Clean Architecture.

## Constitution Check (Post-Design Re-evaluation)

*Re-evaluation after Phase 1 design completion*

- **No Manual Coding**: All implementation will be generated by Claude Code from specs ✓
- **Clean Architecture**: Confirmed with models/services/cli/lib structure ✓
- **Menu-Driven CLI**: Console UI layer handles menu navigation as specified ✓
- **In-Memory Only**: Task repository uses in-memory storage only ✓
- **Auto-Generated Stable IDs**: Task model includes auto-incremented integer IDs ✓
- **Readable and Testable Code**: Architecture supports unit and integration testing ✓
