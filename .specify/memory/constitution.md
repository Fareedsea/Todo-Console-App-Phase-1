# todo-memory-console-app Constitution

## Core Principles

### No Manual Coding
No manual coding — all implementation is generated by Claude Code from specs

### Clean Architecture
Follow clean architecture and separation of concerns

### Menu-Driven CLI
All features must be accessible via a menu-driven CLI

### In-Memory Only
Data must remain in memory only (no files, no database)

### Auto-Generated Stable IDs
IDs must be auto-generated and stable during runtime

### Readable and Testable Code
Code must be readable, testable, and beginner-friendly

## Scope and Out of Scope

Scope (Phase 1 Only): Add Task, View Task List, Update Task, Delete Task, Mark Task Complete / Incomplete. Out of Scope: No persistence, No web UI, No AI chatbot, No authentication, No databases

## Quality Standards

Python 3.13+, Clear console output, Graceful error handling, Predictable behavior

## Governance

Spec-Driven Development with Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code. The system must be simple, deterministic, and fully spec-controlled.
